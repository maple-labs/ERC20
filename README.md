# ERC-20

**DISCLAIMER: This code has NOT been externally audited and is actively being developed. Please do not use in production.**

Basic ERC-20 contract designed to be inherited and extended. Leveraging native overflow checks in solc 0.8 to simplify ERC-20 implementation. It should be noted that this ERC-20 implementation does not include some functionality that is commonly used in other tokens, such as:
- `address(0)` checks on `_transfer`
- `permit()`
- `increaseAllowance`
- `decreaseAllowance`
- `push`
- `pull`

This was intentional, as this ERC-20 was intended to have the minimum functionality necessary, allowing for maximum extendability and customizability. 

To clone, set up and run tests:
```
git clone git@github.com:maple-labs/ERC20.git
dapp update
make test
```
